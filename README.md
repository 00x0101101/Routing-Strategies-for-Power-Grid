# Routing-Strategies-for-Power-Grid
* Proposed a power routing strategy for power grid and strategy for pre- and intraday grid dispatching based on shortest path algorithm (SFPA), depth-first search algorithm and genetic algorithm.
* Used MATLAB to implement the strategies and simulate the effect of the strategies.
* Implemented the increase of power transmission capability by 5% as well as the reduction of the maximum voltage drop in the network by 12% compared with traditional power grid.
